# Cursor Rules Overview

This file is now a short pointer. Auto-attaching rules live under `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` with YAML frontmatter (`description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`).

Rules added:

- `/.cursor/rules/00-project-basics.mdc` (always applied)
- `/.cursor/rules/server-workflow.mdc` (auto-attaches to `server/**`)
- `/.cursor/rules/client-ui.mdc` (auto-attaches to `client/app/**`)
- `/.cursor/rules/service-hooks.mdc` (auto-attaches to `client/app/hooks/**`)
- `/.cursor/rules/service-architecture.mdc` (auto-attaches to `server/src/services/**`)

Notes:

- `globs` is a comma-separated list without spaces, e.g. `server/**/*.ts,client/app/**/*.tsx`
- Keep this overview concise; put details in the `.mdc` files
