- Prefer Material-UI defaults; minimal customization
- Centralize custom styles in `client/app/theme.ts`
- Avoid one-off untyped CSS or duplicated `sx`; prefer theme and MUI props
- Use `rem` units for font sizes
- Abstract responsive breakpoints via a single custom hook (avoid prop threading)
- Keep individual components under 500 lines; extract subcomponents when needed
